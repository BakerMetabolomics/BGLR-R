The following data and code is reproduced from the supplementary data from [de los Campos et al., Nat. Comm., 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18480-y).

**Before you run the code below, dowload the following: 

  - [FW.BGLR](https://github.com/gdlc/BGLR-R/blob/master/R/FW_BGLR.R)- function
  - [Sample Data](https://github.com/gdlc/BGLR-R/blob/master/data/sample_FW.RData)

Here we present a function to perform the Finlay-Wilkinson (1963)
analysis in two steps using the BGLR (Pérez and de los Campos) package
in R (R Core Team, 2019). We created the R function 
FW.BGLR to perform the analysis. The function takes the 
following arguments:

	- pheno: a data.frame with 3 columns, VAR (variety), 
	  ENV (environment), y (response variable).
	- X: matrix of markers coded for additive effects (e.g, 0, 1, 2).
	- G: matrix with genomic relationships between individuals.

The matrix **X** contains marker information for the varieties given in the 
data.frame. This matrix is used to compute the additive relationships between 
individuals (Lopez-Cruz et al., 2015) if matrix **G** is not given. 

The function returns a list object with the following elements:

	- yHat: vector with predicted values for the response variable.
	- VAR: a data frame with the columns ID (varieties), 
	  int (estimated intercept), intSD (estimated standard deviation for intercept),
	  slope (estimated slope) and  slopeSD (estimated standard deviation for slope).
	- ENV: vector with environmental effects.
	
The following R code shows how to load sample data (raw means).

```{r}

 # Load data
  load("sample_FW.RData")

 #list objects, at this point you should have at least 2 objects: pheno and G.
  ls()

```
	
The code below shows how to load the function and perform the analysis assuming 
that objects pheno and G are already loaded in the R environment.


```{r}
 # Loads BGLR library
  library(BGLR)

 # Loads function for FW analysis
  source("FW_BGLR.R")

 # Fits FW-regression in two steps
  fm<-FW.BGLR(pheno=pheno,G=G,verbose=FALSE)

 # Predictions
  head(fm$yHat)

 # Intercept and slopes
  head(fm$VAR)

 # Environmental effects
  head(fm$ENV)

 # Plot Environment effect vs Genotype performance
  plot.FW(fm,pheno)

```
