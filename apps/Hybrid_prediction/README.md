## Hybrid perediction using G-BLUP

This app fits GBLUP models to predict hybrid performance. The problem is to predict hybrid performance 
using genotipic information from parents. The data that we have available is as follows:

- Genotypic information from males and females (genomic relationship matrixes).
- Phenotypic information for some hybrids.
